The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an opensource database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. 
The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.
The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
Using this data need to find the insights and trend in data.
This is Done by my individual efforts.
